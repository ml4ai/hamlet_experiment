handling missing data
noise model holds the data (because at the "end" of the generative process)
add Ym_ for missing data: kjb::Matrix(size_t) TxK -- 1 indicates missing
add flag for whether missing data is present
extend hamlet.cpp setup to check parameter file for explicit flag of missing data
log_likelihood handles computation to ignore partial missing data
    (easy with Gaussian as any marginal is also Gaussian)
